ðŸ›µ **Used Bike Sales in India â€“ Data Cleaning, Encoding & Visualization**

This project focuses on cleaning, label encoding, and visual analysis of a used bike sales dataset from India. It serves as a foundational example for beginner-level exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.

ðŸ“‚ **Dataset Description**

The dataset includes detailed bike listings with features like:

Brand, Model, Engine Capacity

Mileage, Fuel Type

Year of Manufacture, Registration Year

Seller Type, Owner Type, Insurance Status

Price, Resale Price, and City Tier

âœ… **Tasks Completed**

ðŸ§¹ 1. Data Cleaning

Checked for duplicates - Nil

Verified that there are no missing values

Converted object datatypes to categorical/numeric where appropriate

ðŸ§ª 2. Label Encoding

Applied LabelEncoder from sklearn to all categorical columns

Preserved encoder mappings using a dictionary of encoders

ðŸ“ˆ 3. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization

Answered 20 statistical questions about the dataset

Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for:

Static plots (bar plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps)

Interactive and animated charts (e.g., price trends over years by engine size)

Visualized high-mileage bikes, city-wise resale trends, and engine capacity patterns

ðŸ§° **Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data cleaning and transformation

Scikit-learn â€“ Label encoding

Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Static visualization

Plotly Express â€“ Interactive and animated charts

VS Code â€“ Development environment
